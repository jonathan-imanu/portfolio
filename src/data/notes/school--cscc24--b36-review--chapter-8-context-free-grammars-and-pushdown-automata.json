  "content": "# Context-free Grammars\n\nA general mechanism for describing how to generate strings. It is specified as a list of so-called productions.\n\nFormally, a CFG is a tuple $G = (V, \\sum, P, S)$ where $V$ is a set of variables, $\\sum$ is a set of terminals, $P$ is a set of productions, and $S$ is a particular element of $V$, called the start symbol. \n- It must be the case that $V \\cap \\sum = \\emptyset$\n- $\\forall p \\in P$, $p$ has the form $A \\rightarrow \\alpha$ \n\nDerivations in $G$ are defined based on the relation $\\rightarrow_{G}$ \n- We say $\\alpha, \\beta \\in (V \\cup \\sum)^*, \\alpha \\rightarrow_{G} \\beta \\iff \\alpha = \\alpha_1A\\alpha_2, \\beta = \\alpha_1C\\alpha_2$ where \n\t- $A \\rightarrow C$ is a production and $\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2 \\in (V \\cup \\sum)^*$\n\nGiven a CFG $G = (V, \\sum, P, S)$, **$L(G)$ is the language generated by $G$.** We say that it is the set of all strings of terminals that can be derived from the start symbol of $G$.\n- $L(G) = \\{ x \\in \\sum^* : S \\rightarrow_{G}^{*} x\\}$\n\t- if a language $L$ can be represented in this way it is a *context-free language (CFL)*\n##### CFG's are more powerful than regular expressions\n\n*For every regular expression $R$ there is a CFG $G$ such that $L(G) = L(R)$* \n## Right-linear grammars and regular languages\n\nA CFG $G = (V, \\sum, P, S)$ is **right-linear** if every production in $P$ is of the form $A \\rightarrow \\epsilon$ or $A \\rightarrow xB$ where $A, B \\in V$ and $x \\in \\sum^*$. \n- The RHS of every production is the empty string OR a string of terminals followed by a single variable\n\n*Right-linear CFGs generate **exactly** the set of regular expressions*\n\nA **strict right-linear** language also has the property that $|x| \\leq 1$ \n- The variable on the RHS (the $B$ in $A \\rightarrow xB$) is preceded by an empty string or single terminal \n\t- Equivalently the $x$ in $A \\rightarrow xB$ is an empty string or single terminal\n\n **The languages generated by strict right-linear grammars CFGs are regular**\n# Pushdown Automata\n\nThe automata that can accept CFLs.\n\nIt is a FSA augmented with a stack as auxiliary storage. This allows it to overcome the limitations (only remembering a finite number of things) of traditional FSAs since the size of the stack is unbounded.\n\nA **pushdown automaton (PDA)** is a tuple $M = (Q, \\sum, \\gamma, \\delta, q_0, F)$ where\n- $Q$ is the finite nonempty set of states\n- $\\sum$ is the finite set of input symbols\n- $\\gamma$ is the finite set of stack symbols\n- $q_0 \\in Q$ is the start state\n- $F \\subseteq Q$ is the set of accepting states\n\t- $\\delta$ is the transition function $\\delta: Q \\times (\\sum \\cup \\{ \\epsilon \\}) \\times (\\gamma \\cup \\{ \\epsilon \\}) \\rightarrow P(Q \\times (\\gamma \\cup \\{ \\epsilon \\}))$\n\t- $\\delta$ maps to a state, an input symbol and a stack symbol to a set of pairs each consisting of a stack and stack symbol. \n",

  "content": "# 7.1 Regular Expressions\n\nAn **alphabet** is a set $\\sum$  whose elements are called **symbols**. A string, over a specified alphabet $\\sum$ is a finite sequence of symbols from $\\sum$. The empty sequence is a string and is denoted $\\epsilon$. \n\nThe set of all strings over alphabet $\\sum$ is denoted $\\sum^*$ \n\nA **language** (over alphabet $\\sum$) is a subset of $\\sum^*$\n\nIf $S, T$ are languages:\n- + denotes their union\n- $ST = \\{\\, xy \\mid x \\in S,\\; y \\in T \\,\\}$ is concatenation\n- $S^*$ is the Kleene Star which is the set of all possible concatenations of 0 or more strings in L.\n# 7.2 Regular Expressions\n\n**Definition**: Given a finite alphabet $\\sum$, the set of regular expressions $RE$ over that alphabet is the smallest set such that:\n- Basis: $\\emptyset, \\epsilon$, and $a$ for $a \\in \\sum$ belong to $RE$\n- Induction Step: If $S, T$ are in $RE$ then $(S + T), (ST), S^*$ also belong to $RE$\n# 7.3 Deterministic Finite State Automata\n\nA **deterministic finite state automaton (DFSA)** is a mathematical model of a machine which, given any input string x, accepts or rejects x. The automaton has a finite set of states, including a designated initial state and a designated set of accepting states.\n- Represented as directed graphs\n\nA DFSA $M$ is a quintuple $M = (Q, \\sum, \\delta, s, F)$ where:\n- $Q$ is a finite set of states\n- $\\sum$ is a finite alphabet\n- $\\delta: Q X \\sum \\rightarrow Q$ is the transition function\n\t- Read in a set of states and a single character to output a set of states\n- $s \\in Q$ is the initial state\n- $F \\subseteq Q$ are the accepting states\n\n**Extended Transition Function**: The function $\\delta^* : Q X \\sum^* \\rightarrow Q$ is defined via structural induction and can be thought of as “Start in state q and read an entire string x.”\n- The ETF makes it easy to define stuff\n\t- For example, we say that $x \\in \\sum^*$ is accepted iff $\\delta^*(s, x) \\in F$ \n# 7.4 Nondeterministic Finite State Automata\n\nA **Nondeterministic Finite State Automata (NFSA)** is finite state automaton where, for a given state and input, there multiple next states.\n\nSimilarly to a DFSA, a NFSA is a quintuple $M = (Q, \\sum, \\delta, s, F)$. The key difference is that the transition function $\\delta: Q X (\\sum \\cup \\{ \\epsilon\\}) \\rightarrow P(Q)$. The ETF for NFSA follows from this definition and is similar to that of a DFSA.\n\n# 7.7 Pumping Lemma\n\nFSA has a fixed number of states so it can only \"remember\" so much. \n\nThe *Pumping Lemma* states that any sufficiently long string of a regular language $L$ has a nonempty substring which can be repeated (“pumped”) an arbitrary number of times, with the resulting string still being in $L$.\n\nFormally:\n\n**Pumping Lemma**: Let $L \\subseteq \\sum^*$  be a regular language. Then there is some $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ (that depends on $L$) so that every $x \\in L$ that has length $n$ or more satisfies the following property:\n- There are $u,v,w \\in \\sum^*$ such that $x = uvw$, $v \\neq \\epsilon, |uv| \\leq n$ and $uv^kw \\in L$ for all $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$ \n",

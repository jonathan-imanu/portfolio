Hence L6 writes $w^*(i)$ in `opt[i]` and L7 returns it.\n\n#### Lemma 2\n##### Claim\n\n$\\forall i \\in [n]$, WIS(i) is called at most once.\n##### Proof\n\nObserve that when WIS(i) is called, the algorithm, including all of the recursive calls only calls WIS with inputs smaller than i. For $i = n$, WIS(n) is only called in L8 and never again. For $i < n$, WIS(i) can only be called in L5. This only happens when `opt[i]` is undefined. But after calling WIS(i) once, `opt[i]` is defined by (by previous lemma). Hence WIS(i) is called at most once.\n\n## Knapsack\n\nGet recursive formula. Prove the recursive formula holds via an exchange argument. THEN correctness of the iterative case it obvious.\n### Pseudopolynomial Time\n\nPolynomial in $n$ and the number $W$ which can be thought of as a parameter. $W$ is represented as a binary string of length $\\lceil \\log_2(W) \\rceil$. THEN a real polynomial time algorithm would run in time $poly(n \\log W)$.  Thus our proposed algorithm is called pseudo-polynomial time. \n\n## Shortest Paths\n\n### Setup \n\n- We have a directed graph $G = (V = [n], E)$\n- Edges are weighted $w: E \\rightarrow R$ \n\t- We have negative edges\n\t- Cost of non-edges\n#### Representation of Inputs\n\n### SSSP: Bellman-Ford\n\n- Fix $s \\in [n]$\n- For every $v \\in [n]$, let $w^*(v) = dist(s, v)$\n- For every $v \\in [n]$ and $i \\in [n - 1]$, let $w^*(i)$ be the minimal weight of a path from $s$ to $v$ of length at most $i$\n#### **Lemma** \n\nFor all $v \\in [n],$ we have $w^*(v)= w^*(v, n-1)$\n##### Proof\n\nFor every $s,t \\in v$ there is a shortest path of length less than $n - 1$. \n",

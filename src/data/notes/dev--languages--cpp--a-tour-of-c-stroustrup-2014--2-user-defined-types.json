  "content": "### Classes\n\nA function / method with the same name as the class is called the constructor.\n\n**A struct is simply a class with members public by default**\n### Union \n\nA struct where all members are allocated at the same address so that the union occupies only as much space as its largest member. A union can only hold a value for one member at a time.\n\n**Advice:** Use a tagged enum with real functionality hidden behind a abstraction since maintaining correspondence with the tag and access will be error prone.\n",

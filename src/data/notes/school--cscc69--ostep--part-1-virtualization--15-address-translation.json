  "content": "**Address Translation:** The hardware transforms each memory access (e.g., an instruction fetch, load, or store), changing the virtual address provided by the instruction to a physical address where the desired information is actually located.\n### Dynamic (Hardware-based) Relocation\n\n#### Base & Bounds / Dynamic Relocation\n\nAn older way that isn't used by modern systems. \n\nThere are two hardware registers within each CPU that correspond to the currently running process:\n1. Base\n2. Bounds\n\nThese two registers work together to help translate virtual memory addresses into physical memory addresses:\n\n`physical address = virtual address + base`\n\nThe bounds register ensures these addresses are within the confines of address space.\n\n*These are hardware structures that exist on the chip.* May be called the **Memory Management Unit (MMU).**\n\nOf course, the OS is responsible for updating these registers when switching between processes. \n\nHas the following limitations:\n\n- Stack, heap & instructions are all treated the same\n\t- Memory can be wasted due to **internal fragmentation** which is when within an address space, memory intended to be free space for the stack and heap to grow is unused.\n- Process's address space must correspond to a contiguous block in physical memory\n\t- So it must fit within memory as well\n\n\n\n",

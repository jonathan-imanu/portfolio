  "content": "## The Idea of Duck Typing\n\n*If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, treat it as a duck.*\n\n> An object’s suitability is determined by the methods and behaviours it provides, not by its type or inheritance.\n\n### `classmethod` Versus `staticmethod`\n\n`@classmethod`: Changes the way the method is called so it receives the class itself as the first argument instead of the instance.\n\n`@staticmethod`: Changes the method so it receives no special first argument. It essentials make the method a plain function that just happens to live in the method body.\n\n### No such thing as private attrs\n\nPrefixing a variable with `__` doesn't mean that other people can't access but rather that the name gets mangled with `_CLASSNAME__VARNAME` to prevent subclasses to prevent clobbering. *It's about safety NOT security*\n## Saving Memory with `__slots__`\n\n**Savings are nontrivial when dealing with a large quantity of objects**\n\nNormally, Python stores the attributes of each instance in a dict named `__dict__`.\n\nDefine a class attribute named `__slots__` holding a sequence of attribute names, Python uses an alternative storage model for the instance attributes: the attributes named in `__slots__` are stored in a hidden array or references that use less memory than a dict.\n\n- You must remember to redeclare __slots__ in each subclass to prevent their instances from having __dict__.\n- Instances will only be able to have the attributes listed in __slots__, unless you include '__dict__' in __slots__ (but doing so may negate the memory savings). \n- Classes using __slots__ cannot use the `@cached_property` decorator, unless they explicitly name '__dict__' in __slots__. \n- Instances cannot be targets of weak references, unless you add '__weakref__' in __slots__.\n\n",

  "content": "# Grammars\n\n*A good chunk of this week was review from weeks 7 & 8 of b36. Didn't take notes on those slides, refer to b36-review*\n\nRemember from B36, that **grammars** generate a language.\n### Regular Grammars\n\nMore restrictive than CFGs. They are limited to productions of the form:\n\n- **Left-recursive Grammar**: At most one non-terminal and it appears as the left-most symbol in the string on the RHS of the production rule.\n\n```\n<S> ::= <T> a b\n<T> ::= a | <T> b\n```\n\n- **Right-recursive Grammar**: At most one non-terminal and it appears as the right-most symbol in the string on the RHS of the production rule\n\n```\n<S> ::= a <T>\n<T> ::= b <T> | a b\n```\n\n### Extended BNF\n\nThe CFGs we've encountered are in **Backus-Naur Form**. There are extensions to BNF that make it more concise BUT NOT more powerful.\n- EG `[ blah ]` denotes that `blah` is optional\n- There is no standard EBNF\n### derivation\n\n*Also B36 review*\n\nA derivation of string $s$ is the sequence of applications of production rules that generate $s$.\n- A string is in the language generated by a grammar iff there is a derivation for it\n### Parse Tree\n\nA **parse tree** is a tree in which:\n- the root is the start symbol\n- every leaf is a terminal, and\n- every internal node is a non-terminal, and its children correspond, in order, to the RHS of one of its productions in the grammar.\n\nIf we have multiple parse trees for a given string then we have an ambiguous language. \n## Ambiguity\n\nA grammar is ambiguous iff it generates a string for which there are two or more distinct parse trees.\n\nA string is ambiguous with respect to a grammar iff that grammar generates two or more distinct parse trees for the string.\n\n**Tutorial Comment:** A red flag for ambiguity in CFG's is one production becoming two of itself.\n### Adding Precedence\n\nWhen changing a grammar to include precedence, we want the operations with higher precedence to appear closer to the root of the parse tree. Higher precedence operations should appear closer to the leaves.\n- We'll sometimes care about associativity too\n\n",

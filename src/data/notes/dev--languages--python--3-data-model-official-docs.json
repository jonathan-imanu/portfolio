  "content": "All data in a Python program is represented by objects or by relations between objects. Even code is represented by objects.\n\nEvery object has an identity, a type and a value. An object’s _identity_ never changes once it has been created; you may think of it as the object’s address in memory. \n\nObjects are never explicitly destroyed; however, when they become unreachable they may be garbage-collected. **GC is not guaranteed.**\n- `CPython` uses reference counting as it's primary algorithm for GC. \n\t- Essentially, each object keeps count of how many references point to it. \n\t- As soon as  that refcount reaches zero, the object is immediately destroyed\n\t- `CPython` calls the `__del__` method on the object (if defined) and then frees the memory allocated to the object.\n\nLINK: https://emptysqua.re/blog/pypy-garbage-collection-and-a-deadlock/\n- PyPy, GC, Deadlock and how to use `__del__`\nLINK: https://thp.io/2012/python-gc/python_gc_final_2012-01-22.pdf\n- A article on GC implementations across Python implementations\n\n\n\n",

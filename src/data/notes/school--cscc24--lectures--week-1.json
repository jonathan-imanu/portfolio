Compilation: Whole program is translated before execution\n2. Interpretation: Translate and execute one statement at a time\n## Translation\n\nThe process of converting a program written in a high-level language into machine language is called **translation**. It is composed of the following parts:\n\n1. Lexical analysis converts source code into sequence of tokens\n\t1. Regular expressions, finite state automata\n2. Syntactic analysis structures tokens into initial parse tree\n\t1. CFGs, push-down automata\n3. Semantic analysis annotates parse tree with semantic actions\n4. Code generation produces final machine code\n\nParts 1 & 2, are usually just grouped into one step (at least when referencing these stages) called parsing.\n## PL Syntax\n\n**Lexical Rules** specify the form of the building blocks of the language:\n- what's a token\n- how tokens are delimited\n- where white space can go\n- how comments are specified\n\n**Syntax Rules** specify how to put the building blocks together.\n# Bonus\n\n## Donald Knuth\n\n- Think of programs as a piece of literature addressed to human beings rather than a computer\n\n",

  "content": "A more powerful version of Generics\n### Idea\n\nWhen implementing a generic class we often don't to constrict users of that class to only be able to use that class with one type.\n\n**A template is a class or function that we parameterize with a set of types or values.**\n\nTemplates don't exist until we call it! A way for us to get the compiler to write code for us based on our usage.\n\n\n\n\n\n",
